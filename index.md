## About Me

Welcome to Yongsheng's home page. I am currently a assistant engineer at [Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.is.cas.cn), Beijing, where I work on deep learning, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. Before that, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) under the guidance of Prof. Tiejian Luo. I did my bachelor's in Computer Science (excellence program) at Southwest University of Science and Technology.

## Research Interests

An innate desire to teach machines human creativity infatuated me with computer vision. My current interests lie in green (light and efficient) image/video restoration and synthesis.
